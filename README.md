# Ixian-Pool

## About Ixian Pool
Mining pool implementation for the Ixian cryptocurrency. 
Discover Ixian in the main repository here: https://github.com/ProjectIxian

## Pool Repository

The pool repository is split into two parts:

* www: contains the pool html frontend and php scripts that are accessible from the internet
* scripts: script files that should not be accessible from the internet and are part of the internal working of the pool

## Requirements

A typical LAMP/WAMP/MAMP setup is needed for proper functionality.
Development tests were done with the following software versions:
- Apache 2.4
- Mariadb 10.2
- PHP 7.1

The pool operator needs to run an IxianDLT node for the pool to connect to. The node will be responsible with worker share validation, with collecting mining rewards and with performing the periodic payouts.
